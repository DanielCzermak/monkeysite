# Monkey Repository
Project I made for a uni assignment in 2025 to start learning Preact and frontend development basics.  
Main branch has a Preact website with mock data provided through useContext that mimics CRUD db operations.
Other branch has a very basic api next to the website made with node, express, mongodb to actually provide data for the site.
